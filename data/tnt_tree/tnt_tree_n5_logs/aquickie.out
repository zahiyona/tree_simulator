        Search routine used: 
           finding optimal score 20 times independently, using defaults
           of "xmult" plus 10 cycles of tree-drifting (Goloboff
           1999).
           Note: for consensus calculation, trees TBR-collapsed. 
           ALSO NOTE: THIS IS AN OVERKILL FOR MOST DATA SETS!

        Group supports are calculated by TBR-swapping the trees
        found, keeping note of the number of steps needed to
        loose each group.  The labels on branches show absolute
        and relative bremer supports (Goloboff & Farris 2001).
        Groups indicated with a question mark (?) are those
        for which the absolute bremer supports appear to be
        10 or more...

        Resampling is done with 100 replications of symmetric 
        resampling (see Goloboff et al. 2003), analyzing each data 
        set with a single random addition sequence plus TBR
        (collapsing the resulting tree with TBR, see Goloboff &
        Farris, 2001).  The labels on branches show frequency and 
        frequency differences (see Goloboff et al. 2003).
